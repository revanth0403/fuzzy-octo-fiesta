(The Triangle class) Designing a class named Triangle that extends                 GeometricObject. The class contains:                                             Three double data fields named side1, side2, and side3 with default values 1.0 to denote three sides of the triangle.                              ■ A no-arg constructor that creates a default triangle.                          ■ A constructor that creates a triangle with the specified side1, side2, and      side3.                                                                                                                                                     ■ The accessor methods for all three data fields.                              ■ A method named getArea() that returns the area of this triangle.               ■ A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of this triangle.     ■ A method named toString() that returns a string description for the triangle.                                                                                  The toString() method is implemented as follows:                                                                                                            return "Triangle: side1 = " + side1 + " side2 = " + side2 +                      " side3 = " + side3;
